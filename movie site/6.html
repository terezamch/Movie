                        Approximately 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker, the last
                        Jedi, has disappeared. The First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to
                        eliminate Luke and the Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by Luke's twin
                        sister, General Leia Organa, opposes them while searching for Luke to enlist his aid.

                        Resistance pilot Poe Dameron meets village elder Lor San Tekka on the planet Jakku to obtain a
                        map to Luke's location. Stormtroopers under the command of Kylo Ren destroy the village and
                        capture Poe. Poe's droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and encounters a scavenger, Rey, at a
                        junkyard settlement. Ren tortures Poe and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, unable to
                        kill for the First Order, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter; Poe dubs FN-2187
                        "Finn". They crash on Jakku, and Finn appears to be the only survivor. He encounters Rey and
                        BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey and BB-8 flee the
                        planet in a stolen, rundown ship, the Millennium Falcon.

                        The Falcon breaks down, and is captured by a much larger ship, piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca,
                        who reclaim their former vessel. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Solo board the ship and
                        attack, but the five escape in the Falcon. The gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement.
                        At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted to a superweapon capable of destroying
                        star systems, Supreme Leader Snoke orders General Hux to use the weapon for the first time.
                        Snoke also questions Ren about the involvement of his father, Han Solo; Ren protests that Han
                        means nothing to him. The Falcon crew view BB-8's map and determine it is incomplete. Han explains
                        that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order but went into exile after an apprentice turned to the
                        dark side and destroyed all that Luke had built. They travel to the planet Takodana and meet with
                        cantina owner Maz Kanata, who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, but Finn wants to flee on his own.
                        Rey is drawn to a vault and finds the lightsaber that belonged to Luke and his father Anakin
                        Skywalker before him. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods. Maz gives
                        Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.

                        Starkiller Base destroys the Republic capital and fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in
                        search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe,
                        but Rey is captured by Ren and taken to Starkiller Base. Ren interrogates Rey about the map,
                        but she resists his mind-reading. Discovering she, too, can use the Force, she escapes her cell
                        with a Jedi mind trick. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han and Chewbacca.
                        At the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance.
                        As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by
                        attacking a critical facility. Leia urges Han to return their son alive. Using the Falcon, Han,
                        Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the base. They lower its shield, find Rey, set explosives, and
                        encounter Ren. Han confronts Ren, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to
                        abandon the dark side. Though conflicted, Ren kills Han. Enraged, Chewbacca shoots Ren in the
                        side and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance X-wing fighters to attack and start a
                        chain reaction that destroys Starkiller Base.

                        The injured Ren pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Finn battles Ren with the lightsaber, but
                        is overpowered and badly wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and fights Ren, overpowering him with
                        the Force before they are separated by a fissure. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to
                        him, while Rey and Chewbacca escape with Finn in the Falcon. On D'Qar, the Resistance celebrates
                        while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map,
                        which Rey follows with R2-D2 and Chewbacca to an island on a distant planet. She finds Luke and
                        presents him with his lightsaber.

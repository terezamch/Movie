                                After defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing amnesty for their past crimes, Dominic "Dom"
                                Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and the rest of their team have returned to the United States to live
                                normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to
                                help Letty Ortiz regain her memories. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into
                                the secure hospital the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom, before
                                breaking into Luke Hobbs' DSS office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his
                                identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely
                                injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her
                                to tell Brian. However, a bomb, disguised in a package sent from Tokyo, explodes and destroys the
                                Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of their team, is killed by Shaw in Tokyo. Dom later
                                visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking
                                to avenge his brother. Dom then travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, where he meets and races
                                Sean Boswell, a friend of Han's, who gives him personal items found at Han's crash site.

                                Back at Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing and chases after the vehicle,
                                driven by Shaw. Both prepare to fight, but Shaw slips away when a covert ops team arrives,
                                led by a guy who calls himself Mr. Nobody. He says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw
                                if he helps him obtain the God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track
                                down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande.
                                Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then airdrop their cars over the Caucasus
                                Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to
                                Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing the God's Eye, and manages
                                to steal it from the owner's Lykan HyperSport. With the God's Eye near telecommunications
                                repeaters, the team manages to track down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian,
                                Mr. Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his militants,
                                and they are forced to flee while Jakande obtains the God's Eye. At his own request, Mr. Nobody
                                is then left to be evacuated by helicopter. Left with no other choice, the team decides to return to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men on their home turf. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he'll dedicate himself to their family full-time.

                                While Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a stealth helicopter and a drone,
                                Ramsey attempts to hack into the God's Eye while sharing her mobile between their vehicles.
                                Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, breaks out of hospital and destroys the drone. Ramsey then
                                regains control of the God's Eye and shuts it down. Meanwhile, Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one
                                brawl on a parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both, and Shaw is defeated
                                when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's
                                helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, before injuring himself when his car
                                lands and crashes. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the
                                helicopter and killing Jakande. When Dom remains unconscious, the team fears that he is dead.
                                As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and
                                that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, "It's about time".

                                Later, Shaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison.
                                Meanwhile, at a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej and Ramsey
                                observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. Dom silently leaves,
                                but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. As Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian,
                                they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.

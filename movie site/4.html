                        A catastrophic crop blight has made farming increasingly difficult and threatens humanity's
                        survival. Cooper, a widowed former NASA pilot who has an engineering background, runs a farm
                        with his father-in-law, son, and daughter Murphy, who believes her bedroom is haunted by a
                        poltergeist. When the "ghost" creates a pattern in the dust, Cooper realizes someone is using
                        gravity to communicate, and interprets the pattern as geographic coordinates, which Cooper and
                        Murphy follow to a secret NASA facility, where they meet Dr. Brand, Cooper's former professor.

                        Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence, appeared near
                        Saturn 48 years before and leads to a distant galaxy, with numerous potentially habitable
                        planets. Twelve volunteers have gone through it, knowing they may never be able to return,
                        each to assess a planet's suitability as humanity's new home. Miller, Edmunds and Mann have
                        sent encouraging data from planets near Gargantua, a supermassive black hole. Brand recruits
                        Cooper to pilot the spaceship Endurance to evaluate as many of the planets as possible, while
                        he works on "Plan A", a theory to harness gravity for propulsion, which would allow humanity to
                        leave Earth. The Endurance also carries 5,000 frozen embryos as "Plan B", to provide for
                        humanity's survival. Cooper agrees to go, upsetting Murphy.

                        Cooper's crew consists of scientists Romilly, Doyle, Brand's daughter Amelia, and robots TARS
                        and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they head to Miller's planet, an ocean world where time is
                        severely dilated due to its proximity to Gargantua; for each hour there, seven years pass on
                        Earth. While Romilly and TARS remain aboard, the rest descend to the surface, where they find
                        only wreckage. Amelia retrieves Miller's data, before a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle. Cooper,
                        Amelia, and CASE manage to return to Endurance, but 23 years have elapsed on Earth.

                        Murphy, now an adult, has been assisting Dr. Brand with his research. On his deathbed, he admits
                        to her that the gravity equation is unsolvable and Plan A impossible, and that he lied to
                        everyone, pinning his hopes on Plan B. Murphy notifies Amelia of her father's death, then
                        accuses her and Cooper of abandoning Earth. She continues working, believing the equations
                        can be solved if she could somehow get more data on gravitational singularities.

                        With limited fuel, the crew decide to go to Mann's planet, rather than Edmunds', as Mann has
                        been sending promising data. After being revived from cryosleep, Mann assures the crew that
                        while the frozen planet has an ammonia-laden atmosphere, the surface is livable. However, when
                        they are alone, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, revealing that he falsified the data so he would
                        be rescued, then heads for Endurance. Meanwhile, Romilly is killed by a booby trap Mann had set.

                        After Amelia rescues Cooper, they race to Endurance, where Mann is attempting to dock despite
                        being locked out of the autodocking system. Mann ignores Cooper's plea not to open the airlock,
                        which fails catastrophically. Mann is killed and the severely damaged Endurance begins falling
                        out of orbit. Cooper uses the landing craft to stabilize the ship.

                        Using Gargantua's gravity as a slingshot, they head to Edmunds' planet, but their proximity to
                        the black hole means 51 years will elapse on Earth. To shed weight, Cooper jettisons himself and
                        TARS towards the black hole, so that Amelia and CASE can complete the journey. Cooper and TARS
                        pass the event horizon, and find themselves inside a tesseract, which appears as a stream of
                        bookshelves that look into Murphy's bedroom at different times. Cooper surmises that the
                        tesseract and wormhole were created by five-dimensional beings to enable him to communicate
                        with Murphy and that he is her "ghost". He relays in Morse code quantum data that TARS collected
                        from the black hole by manipulating the second hand of a watch he gave to Murphy before he left,
                        which enables Murphy to solve the gravitational equation.

                        Cooper is ejected into normal space and awakens in a space habitat orbiting Saturn. He reunites
                        with an aged Murphy, now near death. At Murphy's urging, Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Amelia
                        on Edmunds' habitable planet, where she and CASE have begun to set up a colony using Plan B.

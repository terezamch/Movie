                    <p class="main-movie-info">When Oh, a loveable misfit from another planet, lands on Earth and finds himself on the run
                        from his own people, he forms an unlikely friendship with an adventurous girl named Tip who
                        is on a quest of her own. Through a series of comic adventures with Tip, Oh comes to understand
                        that being different and making mistakes is all part of being human. And while he changes her
                        planet and she changes his world, they discover the true meaning of the word HOME.
                        Aliens who call themselves the Boov are running from their enemy the Gorg. They come to Earth
                        and they relocate humans in certain cities so that they could move in. One of the Boov who
                        calls himself Oh is annoying but wants to be liked. And when he inadvertently sends a message
                        out of the planet, the Boov fear that the Gorg will follow it to Earth and they blame Oh. He
                        goes on the run, which was what the Boov are good at. He runs into a girl named Tip who was not
                        relocated. She wants to find her mother and Oh promises to help her if she helps him. They form
                        an unusual relationship.
